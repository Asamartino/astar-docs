# Astar and Shiden Token

Astar Token is the native token for Astar Network that has 3 primary functions.

1. dApp Staking
2. Transactions
3. On-chain Governance

## dApps Staking

DApps Staking is an novel scheme invented by the Astar Network core team. Only the Astar provides this benefit in the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole. Astar Network aims to be the leading dApps hub on Polkadot Network. Hence, we prepared incentives for dApp developers to build smart contracts on Astar Network.

dApps Staking is a simple but strong mechanism. Astar token holders can stake Astar tokens on dApps they like and want to support. By doing so, the staker earns Astar tokens from block rewards. In addition, dApp developers get rewards based on the amount staked on them. Accordingly, developers building on Astar Network receive Astar tokens for making smart contracts or infrastructure for Astar Network community. We intend to make it a  sustainable and decentralized crowdfunding mechanism.

## Transactions

Every on-chain transaction requires the sender to pay fees. Part of the fee is burned and part is deposited to the collator.

## On-Chain Governance

We plan to make on-chain governance and Astar token is used for facilitating the governance activities such as voting and referenda.
