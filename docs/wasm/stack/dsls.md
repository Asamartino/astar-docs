# DSLs

## `Ink!`

ink! is an eDSL written in Rust and developed by [Parity](https://www.parity.io/). It specifically targets the API of Substrateâ€™s `pallet-contracts`.

ink! offers Rust [procedural macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html#procedural-macro-hygiene) and a list of crates to facilitate development and avoid boilerplate code.

Check the official documentation [here](https://ink.substrate.io/why-rust-for-smart-contracts) and ink! GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/paritytech/ink).

## `Ask!`

ask! is a framework for AssemblyScript developers to write Wasm smart contracts for `pallet-contracts`. Its syntax is similar to TypeScript.

This project is funded by Polkadot treasury - info [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/949). It is still under development and no release is available at the moment.
