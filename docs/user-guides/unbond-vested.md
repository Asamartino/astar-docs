# Unbonding Vested Tokens

If you participated the Astar/Shiden crowdloan, you will have vested tokens that you can unlock.

To unbond your tokens, go to your wallet and load the account you used to participate.

When your account is loaded you will see your tokens and how many are locked, vested, or transferrable:

Click on the three dots next to 'send' and select 'Unlock vested amount'. When selected, you'll need to confirm and sign the transaction. After this, your vested tokens and now transferrable!
