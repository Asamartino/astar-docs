# dApp Staking


## #Build2Earn and Web3?

At Astar, we envision a future where the internet is truly decentralized, and not controlled by a handful of unckecked giants. We believe the internet should be free and owned by the people, for the people. Its our goal to ensure that people have ownership of their data and assets, and not be at the mercy of intermediaries. This is the essence of the Web3 vision and what drives Astar.

DApp staking is one of the catalysts that will accelerate the Web3 vision to a functioning reality. For this vision to come to fruition, three important things need to occur.

- Transaction costs (i.e. gas fees) need to drop dramatically
- Blockchains need to be interoperable, interconnected, and frictionless
- Great dApps need to be built for users

At Astar Network, we are tackling these three challenges head-on.

The third point, namely — the necessity for great dApps to be built — is the driving force behind **#Build2Earn (our dApp staking initiative)**.

## What is dApp Staking?

For great dApps to be built, developers need to build them. We provide financial incentives for developers to build great dApps.

On the Astar/Shiden Network, dApp staking provides developers with a regular basic income so they can keep building and improving their dApps.

At its core, dApp staking is similar to staking on validators, but in this new paradigm, dApp stakers — also known as nominators — can nominate their Astar/Shiden tokens on dApps they want to support. Anyone who stakes at least 500 ASTR can be a nominator.

At every block, a portion of the rewards goes to dApp staking. This reward is then divided between operators (developers) and nominators. All in all, this creates a powerful incentive for developers to build dApps on Astar/Shiden and for users to support projects they believe in.

On other blockchains, dApp developers often need to apply for grant programs, issue tokens, and fundraise to earn money. Additionally, they often need to pay steep gas fees.

On Astar, as long as a dApp has been nominated, developers can receive a basic income. As a dApp grows in popularity and more members of the community nominate it, the developers who built the dApp in turn receive a greater percentage of the block reward.

For Web3 to flourish, there needs to be a symbiotic relationship between stakers (i.e. nominators), developers, and users. Astar's dApp staking enables this mutually beneficial relationship to occur.

## Why does dApp Staking Matter?

### dApp Stakers (Nominators): Increase in Token Value & High APRs

Astar/Shiden dApp stakers (i.e. nominators) want the value of their tokens to increase but in order to do so, the underlying value of the asset — the Astar/Shiden Network — needs to increase.

One way for the value of tokens to increase is if the total circulation of tokens decreases. The more tokens that are staked, the fewer tokens are in circulation, and the higher the price.

This market dynamic enables dApp stakers to get more long-term value from their tokens while earning high APRs from staking on dApps.

### dApp Users: Increase in dApp & Network Utility

dApp staking also enables the ecosystem to grow and improve in terms of its utility for users. This is because better dApps are built as a result of developers having a strong incentives and support while building them.

Having more (and better) dApps attracts and retains more users, creating a positive flywheel which helps grow the ecosystem and increases the long-term intrinsic value of the network.

### Developers, developers, developers: More Developers in the Ecosystem

Ultimately, the most precious human resource in the Web3 ecosystem is great developers. Before dApp staking, there were little to no sustainable financial incentives for developers to make dApps or to build infrastructure in public blockchains.

With dApp staking, developers can earn regular basic income while building dApps on Astar/Shiden. Having financial incentives entices more developers to build and improve their dApps. This can also help allow developers to be less dependent on token prices, and support them through bear markets.

## Build2Earn Program

Our dApp staking initiative on Astar is foundational to our #Build2Earn program and is the natural continuation of our [#Stake2Earn](https://medium.com/astar-network/stake2earn-festival-411cb712a380) campaign. #Build2Earn is our financial incentive program whose aim is to provide a basic income to developers for building useful dApps on Astar/Shiden.
